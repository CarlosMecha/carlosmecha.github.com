My family and I didn't celebrate Thanksgiving until very recently. Japan and Spain don't have this
tradition but since our 2 kids were born in US, we decided to cook a turkey like any other American
family.

This year has been estrange at best, taken from a sci-fi novel. A pandemic has hit hard every
country on Earth, and has change the lifestyle of many of us. But humans adapt (governments do not,
but that's material for another post).

For my family, we have been extremely lucky in all aspects. Life changes due to the lockdown were
for the best so far. We are very aware that many families are not this lucky. So in
this short post, I'm giving thanks for all things that has happened to us during this _weird-as-shit_ year.


### The family grew

At the beginning of 2020, our second daughter was born. A bit earlier than expected but no
complications. As I write this, she's "chewing" a piece of bread like there's no tomorrow. Taking
care of a baby during the lockdown was easier than I expected, since for the first two months 
you are not supposed to go out often. Had a lot of time to play with our both of them, make a
homelab, and cook. She's now 10 months old and getting ready to start walking.

It also has helped a lot to work from home. I'm spending more time with my daughters than ever
before. Without commuting, I can use that extra time to get the house a bit more organized and
clean.

We've also seen more than 40 guppies born (not all are alive, but that's life). We started a tiny
aquarium with 5 from our friend Brennan and had to expand their habitat quite a lot to make room for
colorful and sometimes bizarre fishes.


### Mapbox's crew

I did a big transition in April. I joined Mapbox as engineering manager of their Tilesets Team. I
was worried I made a big mistake to make such a move in a year like this one. I couldn't imagine
what would be to start in a new company during a pandemic, onboard fully remote in an industry that I
have 0 knowledge about (maps).

But nothing bad happened. Onboarding was pretty smooth. I'm familiar with the technologies and the
most important part, the crew is fantastic. A team of 15 wonderful people ready to listen to my
rants and stupid questions about cartography and maps in general. Not all of them are using _vim_
yet but one step at a time.

Since I started, I've been learning every day about the industry, how to monetize a complex product,
how to work on different timezones, and a hundred little tricks that help me to overcome the
problems of not working in an office with peers.


### Pandemic

We have been following the COVID-19 recommendations as much as we can. We have seen some
friends and family getting infected but no serious cases around us. We are also lucky that
our community and neighbors are taking recommendations very seriously.

But at some point, we had to make some changes at home to keep sanity. Since the public
transportation wasn't (and still isn't) working well, we decided to buy a car. After 9 years living
in a US city without one, it was a good change. We found exactly the one we needed and it's
difficult to imagine what we would do now without it.

Having a car has allow us to discover many remote places in California that don't appear on the
travel webpages. And for the kids to see a bit of California's wild life. In some moments, the fires
didn't make it easy, but this state is huge. I recommend a series of books that can help to explore
California: ["Day Hikes Around" by Robert Stone](http://dayhikebooks.com/).

Another big change was to find a place at home that could be my permanent office set up. The only
space we have for that is a closet in our hall. I had a lot of fun setting up the ethernet,
servers, tiny "desk" (not a desk) and a chair that can't move because there's no room. The closet is
1.5 m by 1.5 m. Honestly I don't recommend it, but it's working so far. After 3 months working
there, I started to feel back, arms, hands, neck and pretty much everywhere pain.

All this has taught us that we would need to make even bigger changes on the long run. Not just for
our kids but for our own sanity. San Francisco is a great city... If you don't have kids, or don't
need to work from home.


### Bye SF

At the beginning of 2021, we are moving to a proper house, with yard and stuff. It's pretty far for
where we live right now, because it's impossible to get anything big enough for a family near San
Francisco. Despite this, is all positive changes.

My daughters will get their own room, and a big backyard for playing all they long. My wife gets a
safe community where she can go out without dealing with the issues that San Francisco currently
have (you all know what I'm talking about), and I got office space and a BBQ setup.

We are going to miss San Francisco. We have a good life here. But did I tell you that I'm going to
have my own BBQ? That is priceless. Next is a Costco membership.


### Segment acquisition

The big elephant in the room. Segment, a company that I spent 3 years of my career got acquired by
Twilio, and for my family (and many many others) gave us a breathe room for the future. The amount
of hard work Segment employees and founders put during these years is incredible. A big chunk of
that exit will go to future endeavours for a little adventure I want to start soon-ish. I've been
thinking about it since I started programming, and looks like the stars are getting in the right
position. Can't share too many details just yet, but as you guessed, it involves ETLs.

Will keep you posted.


### Chicken recipe

And let's finish with the star of tonight. I actually don't know how to properly cook a turkey, but
I get close enough with a medium size chicken and a dutch oven. So here's the recipe that works like
a charm, it's extremely easy to do and requires little preparation:

**Ingredients**

* A whole chicken
* 2 onions
* A couple of carrots
* A lemon
* Fresh rosemary
* Good fresh bread (ciabatta, rustic round, something like that).
* A can of beer (non-IPA)
* Chicken stock
* 4 potatoes
* Olive oil, salt and black pepper

**Preparation**

1. Preheat the oven at 135°C/275°F.
1. Remove the skin of the chicken carefully, trying to keep big chunks of it. Reserve in a dish.
1. Season **a lot** the chicken with salt and pepper.
1. Halve the onions and place them in the dutch oven with olive oil, at high heat until brown, with a pinch of salt.
1. Reserve the onions and do the same with the carrots. 1-2 mins max. Reserve.
1. Put a bit more of olive oil if needed, and place the chicken in the pot, still at high heat, just
   enough time to brown a bit the outer meat. Take the chicken and place it in a dish.
1. Add one cup of beer to the pot, and with a wood spoon, scratch the bottom of the pot for a
   minute, reducing the beer (burning the alcohol) and keeping all the flavors in the liquid.
1. Put the chicken, the onions, the carrots, fresh rosemary, a couple of lemon slices all in the
   pot. Add 1 cup of chicken stock and drink whatever is left on the beer can.
1. Put the lid and introduce the pot on the oven. Leave it there for 2, 2.5 hours.
1. An hour before your chicken is done, put all that skin in small pieces with salt and pepper in a
   oven tray. This would be as appetiser or "torreznos". Put the tray into the oven.
1. 30 mins before your chicken and chicken skin are done, cut the potatoes in slices, put them in a
   bowl with salt and olive oil. Cover that bowl with a plastic sheet and introduce it in the
   microwave for 4 minutes.
1. Take the potatoes, flip them and put them again in the microwave for another 4 minutes.
1. Take another oven tray, put the "almost cooked" potatoes on it, add a bit of black pepper on top
   and let it on the oven.
1. When the chicken is done. Take the pot from the oven, let it rest, and set the oven to "Broil".
1. Check the potatoes and the skin, they should be crispy in a couple of minutes, but be careful
   that they could get burnt almost immediately.

At that point, you won't need a knife to cut the chicken. Serve it with the potatoes, and leave the
liquid on the side to dip some bread. The chicken skin goes perfect with beer. If for some random
reason you don't finish the chicken, keep the liquid, bones and meat in the fridge to make a soup
the next day.

Not all has been perfect for us this year. We miss our families and we don't know when are we going
to be able to travel to our countries. However, I couldn't ask for more in 2020. Thank you!

_I'm getting a BBQ, yeeeey._
