Around 2016 I bought an old ThinkPad x200 to check why everyone was recommending ThinkPad models so
much for Linux users. At that time I had a crappy, 2-year-old Lenovo Ideapad. I hated it. It was
pretty slow, had compatibility issues with any Linux distribution, the keyboard was uncomfortable
and the speakers were closer to a PC-speaker. I was trying to understand how the same brand can make
such a horrible (but expensive) model and at the same time, the most famous and durable laptop ever.

I chose that model because has almost no features (common option for Linux laptop users at that
time), but still it is compatible with most of the modern protocols (WiFi 5GHz, USB 2, DisplayPort,
SATA, modern RAM). It's also quite compact on size, however is thick and a bit heavy, and didn't
have a trackpad (Trackpads are the worst invention since the mouse, prove me wrong).

When it arrived, I wasn't sure what to do with it. It came with Windows 7 Professional that lasted
5 minutes (just enough to `dd` an Ubuntu LTS image). Of course, right after you install Linux, you
might spend some time setting a wallpaper, maybe installing your "dotfiles", spend a couple of hours
playing Battle for Wesnoth or OpenArena. Before I realized, I was using this laptop for coding,
some gaming, checking email and banks, watching YouTube, and hacking in general.

But how long this laptop would last? I was curious, so I stored my old Ideapad in a box, changed the
hard disk of the ThinkPad for a SSD, upgraded the RAM and bought a new battery. And the rest is
history. I'm writing this post in the same computer. The battery lasts for 4 hours (5 if I don't use
the browser much). I've also bought the "Tablet" version, with a touch screen that can rotate 365
degrees (however I don't use it as much).


### The history of the ThinkPad x200

Lenovo introduced this model in 2008 (however you can find some reviews from mid 2007) as part of their 
business notebooks line. It also was the best option if the X300 was too big for your taste. The
main selling point was the size and the battery life. It counted with a Intel Centrino (early
models) or a Intel Core-2 Duo (later ones). The keyboard is probably the last good one in the X
series and it lacks of a Trackpad (that's a feature for me). Other than that, this laptop is
extremely simple, having most of the common characteristics of traditional ThinkPad models, without
sacrificing the sturdiness and durability of this brand.

As any ThinkPad, they are highly configurable. As extras, you could add bluetooth module, modem,
mobile broadband, a very beautiful dock that gives you more usb and audio ports, as well as one of
the first DisplayPort available on the market. Hoverer due to the limited space, it didn't have the
option for a webcam (already present in some models around that time) or microphone.

Newer models represent a big step forward compared with this laptop. That's the main reason ThinkPad
owners prefer the X220 or X240. Their screens are better (higher definition, better contrast and
color), they added a Trackpad (useless in my opinion) and optical drive, and they got rid of the VGA
external display port.

This model lasted in the market for around 2 years... Well, that's the official version, because
it's a computer that you can still find in Ebay and Amazon pretty easily. Laptops from that time
usually had a rusty HDD and between 2 to 4 GB of memory RAM. Luckily, you can upgrade that with
modern hardware, like a 500GB (or more) SSD and up to 16 GB of RAM (not officially supported but it
works).

There's still a lot of life that we can extract from this model. For some workflows, it can compete
with current Chromebooks. It's secure, has a physical switch for communications devices, no webcam or mic
and a beautiful light on top of the screen to project some light to the keyboard. Just enough to see
the keys on low light settings. Lastly, I would say that is one of last laptops where
you can switch any hardware component, instead of being all soldered to the motherboard like newer
models.


### The pros


### The cons

On the software side, Windows 7 is your best bet if need Microsoft's operating system. Windows 10
might run but too slow for any kind of real use. The big potential comes from Linux distributions.
Any modern Linux distro (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10, Fedora 32, Arch, Manjaro, OpenSuse, etc.) will run
perfectly.

Not sure how long this laptop will last, but I'm not in a rush to buy a new one. It's true that has
some limitations, and someone with different hobbies might find it unusable (video editing, mobile
development -if you need a VM for that-, etc.)

This experience has taught me how much we are being sold that new is always better, and
misconceptions about planned obsolescence on technical products. Do you need that extra 0.1GHz of a
new processor compared with last year's one? Or 4K display in a laptop? Maybe you can give a second
life to a not-so-new laptop.

These laptops are still being sold by the hundreds for ~$80 the piece. Imagine how much waste we
could avoid if we consider more often to buy second-hand or pre-owned products. Or schools for
learning purposes.

And now that we are here, how about you check []()? They restore and sell old laptops for a good cause.
