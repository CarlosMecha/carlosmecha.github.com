On my [previous post]({% post_url 2020-11-02-pulselocker-days %}), I talked about how having a common
vision on a company can be the difference between being successful or going in circles. I consider
this such an important part of any startup that is better if I expand a bit what I mean.

As a disclaimer, I'm only focusing on a vision setting that an engineering team would experience in
a tech startup, because is where I had spent most of my career. Other types of companies
might have something similar, so some learnings might also apply. Also, I will be using the terms
"vision", "mission" and "goal" interchangeably in this text.

When a company or startup is created, the founders have an idea they want to realize. That idea
is something they need to believe strongly as they have to work their assess off to make
it happen. In most cases, they also are going to need employees to help with that task. The
employees need to be onboard with the idea during lows and highs. 

Working on a startup involves long hours, working on things outside of your job description, not
having much guidance on pretty much anything, being available while taking time off and all that
sprinkled with uncertainty of "in a month all might be over". Of course, there are huge perks,
the learning experience is more valuable that many degrees and diplomas, flexibility on schedules,
more friendly environment, sometimes even healthy snacks on the kitchenette (ping pong tables,
Nerf guns, consoles and nap pods are not perks) and a juicy exit if all goes well.

But how do you get employees to share and get motivated by an idea and work hard for what would be less
paycheck than a well-established company?

With a promise of money. And a vision. But mostly money... Since there are thousands of blogs and
books about equity, money, salaries, bonuses, etc, let's focus on the vision part.


### A vision for a company

A vision is a common goal and a path that a group of people share. It usually benefits not only the
owners, but someone external to that group. In an tech startup, a vision could refer
to the customers, the main stakeholders. Of course, you can have a vision of "being rich" but that
don't tend to happen for employees, or even founders.

Here are some good examples of visions shared in tech companies:
* "Becoming the best global entertainment distribution service. Licensing entertainment content
  around the world. Creating markets that are accessible to filmmakers." - Netflix
* "To bring free software to the widest audience" - Canonical
* "Belong Anywhere." - Airbnb

Founders and the exec team are in charge of defining the company vision and make sure it's
understood by employees. It should be communicated from the very beginning, in the interviews,
to be one of the incentives for a candidate to apply. Of course, it should be reminded on the
onboarding sessions.

The interesting part comes to individual teams. A company vision might be too broad to define what a
team is doing. If we focus on engineering, it's common to have specialized visions for each
team, and should dictate the roadmap.


### A team charter

People are more interested on an idea and charter that they define themselves. Engineering managers
and product managers could provide guidance, but the decision should be made in consensus by the
team. Once that is defined, the team should be communicating that to other teams, support and
leadership, as their commitment. If the team has budget, is a good idea to get some swag to
commemorate that moment.

When that is set on stone, is time to put it in practice. If the teams are doing quarterly or yearly
planning, each project or initiative should be weight against the vision. Does it fit? Help us to
get closer to the goal? In practice, you can use it as a filter for most of the requests you get
from customers, support or other stakeholders. Of  course, not all is black or white. In some
occasions, the team would need to drift a bit for specific projects, or helping other teams.
However, the big majority of projects that a team tackle should be directed by their vision.

For example, if the vision is defined as "This team will provide non-engineers the best tool
possible to create websites", working on a UI to create visual components would fit perfectly with
the team's charter, however, rewriting the back-end in Rust might not.

I've seen teams struggling, with one or more areas of ownership, flooded with requests from
customers and each planning session going in a hundred different directions. Usually, these kind of
teams have issues retaining talent, or event hiring new engineers. People don't want to be in a pile
of related-but-not-related work.


### Being flexible

In occasions, not everything is as easy as focusing to a single goal. Priorities change, companies
pivot, the market changes, customers ask for things you have never imagined, and that is all good,
but it can be challenging if the team is stuck with an outdated vision.

Be ready to revisit the vision statement every quarter, or even every month. Big changes quickly
and often might mean there's an issue. However, small corrections, or changes after a couple of
months or quarters could be healthy for the team.

Another aspect of having a vision setting on each team is, some projects or features would fall
through the cracks, or some services/systems won't have a clear owner. It's important to remind
collaboration between teams is critical for a success of a company. As a manager, you might want to
work on your negotiation skills. This month your team could help on a feature outside of their
scope, other times you would ask for help to other teams.

Vision and goals are important, but understanding your business needs and changes, and being all in
the same page is a must.

Over the years I've seen engineering teams accomplishing amazing goals. Sometimes it had nothing to
do with their experience or the technical complexity of their product, but how all were driving in
the same direction, hyper-focused on one or two themes and ignoring anything else.

If you are part of an engineering team, experiment and involve the team members on a vision setting
exercise, see results, optimize, and find what motivates everyone there. The investment is quite
minimal and the results could change the outcome of your company.
