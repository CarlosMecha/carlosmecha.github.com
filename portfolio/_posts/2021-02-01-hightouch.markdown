### What am I doing?

- Implemented the first iteration of the Destinations and Sources auto-discovery frameworks. This was crucial to increase the number of integrations to 60.
- Own enterprise-focused destinations and help 500 Fortune companies to integrate with them.
- Design and create a Partnerships API to integrate with other Saas tools to increase user growth with minimal friction. One click, and you are in.
- Set the first configuration framework for infrastructure components.
