# Blog

## Run it using docker

This is the preferred way to do it. Just run the script `./start.sh` and will build the blog and serve
it on `localhost:4000`. Since it's using the same folder as volume, any change on the code will
trigger a rebuild automatically.


## Run it locally

Only recommended if you have a ruby environment set up:

1. Install bundler: `gem install bundler`
1. Install all dependencies: `bundler install`
1. Run it locally, it will start a server [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000): `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## How does it work?

This blog is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and served by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* The configuration is stored in `_config.yml`.
* The general layout of the site is defined in `_layouts/default.html`.
* All different sections are part of the `_include/` folder. Each section is stored as a HTML page.
* Jekyll generates all the static content in the `_site/` folder. Do not store anything there.
