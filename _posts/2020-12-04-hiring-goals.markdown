Recently I've spent quite a lot of time setting up a sourcing pipeline to grow the team that I'm
currently on. Hiring is one of the responsibilities that I enjoy the most at work. It takes a while,
however the impact that can have in the company, each individual and yourself goes beyond any other
task you accomplish as engineering manager.

The difficult part is, however, that hiring is not a science. You, as a hiring manager, need to
learn how to understand people, communicate well, have clear goals and ensure that the interviewer and
interviewee have a safe, relax and fair conversation. There are hundreds of books and studies on how to
hire and what the process should look like. But we are talking about humans, not computers, so each
case and situation is different.

Therefore, becoming good at hiring is a slow and painful process. Painful in the sense that you
learn by making mistakes, many mistakes. It's important to learn from them, and apply the lessons to
the next iterations. Not just you are looking for someone to spend working together 8
hours a day or more, 5 days a week for a long time, but someone that can increase the impact of your
team within the company, solve complex problems, teach and mentor others (including yourself),
respects everyone and also that you can socialize after work. It's a difficult task and the rewards
are incredible.


### Hiring in startups

The hiring process in a tech startup is a bit different than traditional companies. Due to the
growth and the size of them, it's easy to hire with multiple positions open, looking for a wide
variety of skills within the same role and feel that you are always in a rush. Surprisingly, hiring
processes in these kind of companies are longer and more complex. Everyone is looking for the
perfect candidate and the competence is fearsome.

Extraordinary (and lucky) candidates might be doing multiple interviews at the same time, getting
various offers and having to decide between a big salary or a good promise of money (a.k.a. equity).
That's why startups spend **a lot** of money, time and resources to have the best hiring process
possible.

If you are an engineering manager (or any other type of hiring manager) in an startup, be ready to
work on interesting job requirements, follow up with candidates, conducting multiples interviews and
understand each individual candidate.


### What happens when you hire the right person for the job

* Empowering your team
* Opportunities to grow
* Solutions

        

### What happens when you hire the wrong person for the job

Oh boy, where to start. Bad hires can be caused by multiple issues. From rushing interviews to not
being clear of what the role is about, but the result is always the same. From the candidate side,
it's a big waste of time. Unnecessary stress that can even affect their families. Being stuck in a
job that they can't grow for a while will have consequences in the future at many levels. On the
company side, it could make your team unbalanced, create unfairness and slow down things.

Imagine spending 2 to 3 months (sometimes even more) onboarding to find an unhappy member of the
team. Or looking for other teams that can accommodate a new candidate that doesn't fit in your team.
Or ultimately, letting this new employee go.

I always advocate for spending a good amount of time making sure you get the perfect candidate for
the position that you have open. Ah! And a perfect candidate doesn't mean the one who is an expert
on X technology, or that can sell anything, or the one that can work 20 hours a day. Again, the perfect
candidate is the one that makes you and your team grow, respects everyone and cares about the
company and your team's vision.


### Recommendations for a healthy hiring process

I want to share some tips that has helped me in the past to have a clear goal and make the
experience for both sides as good as I can:

* Align on skills
* Sourcing diversity
* Get early signals
* Discuss your product
* Be realistic
* Set proper expectations
* Communicate

I want to end this post with a disclaimer that I still have to learn a lot and make many new
mistakes to be considered even "good" at hiring. My next step is apply some of the concepts that I'm
learning from [Education competencies from
Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/training-and-events/education-competencies)
(Thanks to Chandra for sending me this link!), and also hire 10 more engineers in the next year :D.
