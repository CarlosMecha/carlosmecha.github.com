### The history of the ThinkPad x200

Lenovo introduced this model in 2008 (however you can find some reviews from mid 2007) as part of their 
business notebooks line. It also was the best option if the X300 was too big for your taste. The
main selling point was the size and the battery life. It counted with a Intel Centrino (early
models) or a Intel Core-2 Duo (later ones). The keyboard is probably the last good one in the X
series and it lacks of a Trackpad (that's a feature for me). Other than that, this laptop is
extremely simple, having most of the common characteristics of traditional ThinkPad models, without
sacrificing the sturdiness and durability of this brand.

As any ThinkPad, they are highly configurable. As extras, you could add bluetooth module, modem,
mobile broadband, a very beautiful dock that gives you more usb and audio ports, as well as one of
the first DisplayPort available on the market. Hoverer due to the limited space, it didn't have the
option for a webcam (already present in some models around that time) or microphone.

Newer models represent a big step forward compared with this laptop. That's the main reason ThinkPad
owners prefer the X220 or X240. Their screens are better (higher definition, better contrast and
color), they added a Trackpad (useless in my opinion) and optical drive, and they got rid of the VGA
external display port.

This model lasted in the market for around 2 years... Well, that's the official version, because
it's a computer that you can still find in Ebay and Amazon pretty easily. Laptops from that time
usually had a rusty HDD and between 2 to 4 GB of memory RAM. Luckily, you can upgrade that with
modern hardware, like a 500GB (or more) SSD and up to 16 GB of RAM (not officially supported but it
works).

There's still a lot of life that we can extract from this model. For some workflows, it can compete
with current Chromebooks. It's secure, has a physical switch for communications devices, no webcam or mic
and a beautiful light on top of the screen to project some light to the keyboard. Just enough to see
the keys on low light settings. Lastly, I would say that is one of last laptops where
you can switch any hardware component, instead of being all soldered to the motherboard like newer
models.


On the software side, Windows 7 is your best bet if need Microsoft's operating system. Windows 10
might run but too slow for any kind of real use. The big potential comes from Linux distributions.
Any modern Linux distro (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10, Fedora 32, Arch, Manjaro, OpenSuse, etc.) will run
perfectly.
