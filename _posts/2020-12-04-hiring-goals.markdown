Recently I've been spending quite a lot of time setting up a sourcing pipeline to grow the team that I'm
currently on. Hiring is one of the responsibilities that I enjoy the most at work. It takes a while,
however the impact that can have in the company, each individual and yourself goes beyond any other
task you accomplish as engineering manager.

The difficult part is, however, that hiring is not a science. You, as a hiring manager, need to
learn how to understand people, communicate well, have clear goals and ensure that the interviewer and
interviewee have a safe, relax and fair conversation. There are hundreds of books and studies on how to
hire and what the process should look like. But we are talking about humans, not computers, so each
case and situation is different.

Therefore, becoming good at hiring is a slow and painful process. Painful in the sense that you
learn by making mistakes, many mistakes. It's important to learn from them, and apply the lessons to
the next iterations. Not just you are looking for someone to spend working together 8
hours a day or more, 5 days a week for a long time, but someone that can increase the impact of your
team within the company, solve complex problems, teach and mentor others (including yourself),
respects everyone and also that you can socialize with after work. It's a difficult task and the rewards
are incredible.


### Hiring in startups

The hiring process in a tech startup is a bit different than traditional companies. Due to the
focus on growth and the size of the startups, it's easy to hire with multiple positions open, looking for a wide
variety of skills within the same role and feel that you are always in a rush. Surprisingly, hiring
processes in these kind of companies are longer and more complex. Everyone is looking for the
perfect candidate and the competence is fearsome.

Extraordinary (and lucky) candidates might be doing multiple interviews at the same time, getting
various offers and having to decide between a big salary or a good promise of money (a.k.a. equity).
That's why startups spend **a lot** of money, time and resources to have the best hiring process
possible.

If you are an engineering manager (or any other type of hiring manager) in an startup, be ready to
work on interesting job requirements, follow up with candidates, conducting multiples interviews and
understand each individual candidate.


### What happens when you hire the right person for the job

Finding the perfect candidate always gives a big boost of morale to your team. New member means new
opportunities to learn and improve existing processes and workflows. It also adds new skills to the
pool of amazing things your team can do. The onboarding time is perfect to detect gaps on your
documentation and tooling (and even product).

If the new member is a bit less senior than the rest of the team, they will bring positive energy
and a fresh view that could unblock projects or solutions. Also I've found that junior engineers
love to talk with customers. If the member is more senior, they bring a lot of "lessons learned"
from previous jobs.


### What happens when you hire the wrong person for the job

Oh boy, where to start. Bad hires can be caused by multiple issues. From rushing interviews to not
being clear of what the role is about, but the result is always the same. From the candidate side,
it's a big waste of time. Unnecessary stress that can even affect their families. Being stuck in a
job that they can't grow for a while will have consequences at many levels. On the
company side, it could make your team unbalanced, create unfairness and slow down things.

Imagine spending 2 to 3 months (sometimes even more) onboarding to find an unhappy member of the
team. Or looking for other teams that can accommodate a new candidate that doesn't fit in your team.
Or ultimately, letting this new employee go.

I always advocate for spending a good amount of time making sure you get the perfect candidate for
the position that you have open. Ah! And a perfect candidate doesn't mean the one who is an expert
on X technology, or that can sell anything, or the one that can work 20 hours a day. Again, the perfect
candidate is the one that makes you and your team grow, respects everyone, is willing to learn and
cares about the company and your team's vision.


### Recommendations for a healthy hiring process

I want to share some tips that has helped me in the past to have a clear goal and make the
experience for both sides as good as I can:

**Understand what you need:** Before looking into anyone's resume or CV, be sure what kind of skills and
competencies would be required to be successful in the position you have open. Also understand how
much flexibility you have to hire. Are you able to hire someone with less experience, because you
have enough time to coach? Or you are expecting someone expert that can create value after week 4?
Answering these questions are critical to create an efficient sourcing pipeline.

**Sourcing diversity:** To find exceptional candidates, you need to work hard on sourcing. You need
to be open minded and go extra-length to get people with a variety of backgrounds. Give
opportunities to people that might not check all the boxes (initially) but could make your team more
diverse.

**Get the right signals as early as possible:** Hiring is expensive. Not just the offer but all the
time spent on it. Make sure you get the signals that you are looking for as early as possible in the
process. The candidate can focus on other applications while you can spend more time in people that
fit more what you are looking for. Be ready to tweak the process as needed to find that signal that
you need. Remember that each person is different.

**Show your product:** I can't count how many companies I've interviewed in the past that they
haven't mention their product or service during the hiring process. Make sure the candidate
understands or is familiar with the product that you hire for. Give a quick demo if needed. It's
important to get people that is motivated by the mission and goal of the company.

**Be realistic:** Always try to hire someone that makes your team better, that raises the bar. But
be realistic. You can't ask for an expert on a technology and pay her like a new entry job. Be ready
to spend big bucks, or find someone with less experience. If your position has been opened for many
months with no success, could be that you are not being real with the bar that you are setting.

**Set proper expectations:** Explain one and a hundred times what are the responsibilities and areas
of ownership of the new role, and give real examples of what the day-to-day is. Also describe really
clear what you are expecting from them. There's nothing worst than starting a new job and not
understanding if you are doing a good or bad job.

**(Over)Communicate:** For the interviewee, the process is way more stressful than to you. It's a
great idea of being in close contact with the candidate. Ask for feedback, explain next steps, and
follow up in a timely manner, regardless the result of the interview. Also be ready to give feedback
if the candidate ask for it.

And for the love of your mother, **stop doing interviews that don't have any correlation with what
they would end up doing on the day-to-day at work.**

I want to end this post with a disclaimer that I still have to learn a lot and make many new
mistakes to be considered even "good" at hiring. My next step is to apply some of the concepts that I'm
learning from [Education competencies from
Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/training-and-events/education-competencies)
(Thanks to Chandra for sending me this link!), and also hire 10 more engineers in the next year :D.
