What a crazy week! On Friday, I got a mysterious text from one of my former coworkers
saying "congrats carlos". I thought it could be related to the recent product lunch my team did
at Mapbox, but his next text left me without words: "segment gettign acquired". My answer was a
"Wait wat????? April fools?" and from there, it snowballed. I honestly didn't know what that meant
for me, so I started to contact other Segment former employees, and I got the sense that I wasn't
the only one.

The next days were madness between emails, calls, video calls and appointments. Everyone I spoke
with was excited, every employee saw their efforts rewarded. Not every company and founders do that
for their former employees.

Now that the dust is settled, I would like to take this opportunity to list some of the lessons
Segment left on my brain for the 3 years I worked there.


### Life is more important

During my time at Segment, I had 2 daughters, my apartment "melted down" due to a fire in floor
above ours, 2 temporary moves, multiple trips everywhere (Japan, Spain, Hawaii, Switzerland, All
California, New York, and a couple of other places), a change of career and a discovery of a new
hobby as sausage maker. I was able to do that because my coworkers and the company culture let me
focus on what was important.

It's impossible to give your max at work if your life is not set the way you need it to be. Segment
and all the managers (5!) I reported on those 3 years understood that. That is a highly valuable
lesson as an engineer manager. Your team will need your help sometimes to take care of their family
and things outside of work. Your job is to make sure they have the time and enough life/work balance
to make that possible.

"We are all people before engineers." - Gerhard E.


### It's all about setting proper expectations

This is probably the lesson that took longer to learn. And I still need to improve. The basic idea
is: It's in our hands as engineers to set expectations with stakeholders about what we are doing or
delivering. As everyone knows, getting proper date estimations for software engineering projects is
quite hard (not impossible as many people like to think), so missing the deadline is
something that happens often in our profession. That is ok. We need to set expectation with the
customer, your boss, the other team, support, etc.

To set the expectation, first we need to do an stellar job at keeping track of everything we do as
engineering team, and also everything that we have promised (or the stakeholder things that we have
promised), and the minute we detect a delay, change of plans or priorities, we should be crisp on
the communication and do it immediately. Usually that kind of updates are not well received, so be
ready to answer the "why", "why that wasn't accounted on the original plan" and other related
questions. Again, that is ok.

Shipping any project is just a game of balancing expectations. The technical part has less weight
that you might imagine. I've been in both sides of that game and knowing this left me more prepare
for pushing the balance on my direction. I always try to encourage my team to be part of
conversations with stakeholders with preparation before hand, so they understand how overwork and
stress is futile if the other party have the wrong expectations.

A last note regarding expectations, usually stakeholders (including yourself) will hear and keep
what is more convenient for them, so make sure you account for that on your plan: "Your estimate said
around one week, it has pass exactly one week. Where is it?"


### Complexity is not worth it

It really isn't. As engineers, we love to create complex systems, they are fun and test our
knowledge, but we don't love to maintain them so much... It's because maintaining or dealing with a
complex system in production is a pain in the :butt:. No one wants to start in a new team and get as
task to onboard in a system with hundreds of features, missing documentation (by definition the
documentation will always be out of date) and tribal knowledge.

Keeping in the head all edge cases, testing strategies, inputs, outputs is exhausting. And also
customers don't want to deal with over-complex products.

Could you cut extra features? Do it. Could you update the documentation explaining what the system
is not for? Really do it. Could you limit what a customer does with your product? They will thank
you.

Of course this only applies if you are trading complexity for stability. A simple and unstable
product is worthless.


### Stop coding (as EM)

My transition to engineering manager was quite difficult. I had no idea what I was doing and also I
was reporting to Segment's CTO (hi Calvin!). He coached me as much as he could but my brain still
was on "engineering mode", so I had the impression that my performance was tied to my output.
Managers' output is difficult to measure, because you need to account for the entire output of the
team and also the impact around it. The easy answer was "If I code this really quickly, that means
I'm doing a great job right?" Wrong.

What I didn't realized at that time is while I was coding, the team didn't have a manager. I shipped
a couple of features and fixes but there weren't wins for the team, quite the opposite, the impact
of the team was lower during these periods. I should have spent all that time hiring (important!),
advocating for the team, and talking with customers or stakeholders.

I still need to manage the impulse of "just do it", and I've develop some strategies outside of
work to keep the engineering lizard under control, like making a homelab at home, redo the network
and other geeky stuff.


### Help others to help you

I like to rant. I quite enjoy a quick rant at the beginning of a meeting on how everything is
turning into shit. Maybe is not something that I should feel proud of but it's a lot of fun. Also
doesn't help to solve any problem.

In most cases, the more that you go up on your career, the less support you get from your managers.
That is normal. But also mean your managers will have less time for you. You should be fixing what
you can fix, but also, when flagging problems to leadership, be ready to propose a solution just
to move the conversation forward. It doesn't matter that the solution is not doable, but you are
demonstrating to your manager that you can do more things that ranting.

Ah, but as a manager, be ready to listen rants. Most of your direct reports only have you to listen
to them, so it's worth it to create that safe space where there's time for raising problems and
solutions.

I'm not sure if these lessons are a common experience for people who works (or worked) at Segment,
but I just want to thank everyone I worked with during these 3 short, fast and crazy years. I
would a completely different person if I didn't join Segment at that time.
